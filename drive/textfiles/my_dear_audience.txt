My dear audience:

In light of certain matters and events which have transpired
I, John Aland, Jr., son of the famous Writer
Whom you may have heard of, a disappointing son to a famous father
Write these words, write this verse, write a lamb to the slaughter

Tell me
How do you write a man, what defines his legacy
If he does not excel, if he is not your prodigy
If from his hands no sacred notes or letters fly
If he must head to the grave nameless, slowly, just to die

What’s in a name? Only a thousand tons of remains
My father he makes around me like a golden frame
Illuminating Ruminating Consummating what defines me
Before I was even set to be born a witless child—see!
The weight of greatness, the weight of scintillating greats yes
See the weight of a mind that speaks louder than mine own I find
Inside my own head, ready always to take over
When I falter, to let me know I was no true soldier

Essentially, I’m a mess of shoddy half-affairs
A waste of air, an endless fountain of despair
My mediocre pen is curbed by my own anxiety
My depression the ultimate source of my sobriety
Every time I raise my hand, my own hand abrades me
My empty words my hollow verse they all work to erase me
What’s the value of the man who’s not the greatest one you see
How can I go on when going on leaves no trace of me

Who will remember someone who doesn’t deserve to be remembered
When they’re alive, much less when they’re dead and dismembered?
