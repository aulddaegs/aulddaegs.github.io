<p>In 1976, the small island nation of Havland produced one of the lost predecessors to today's TTRPG (tabletop roleplaying game) craze. While D&amp;D developed in the United States from Chainmail and Tunnels and Trolls developed after D&amp;D reached the UK, for a long time Havland had no significant wargame or TTRPG scene except as an extension of the wargaming (kriegspiel) scene in neighbouring Denmark. However, a small group of enthusiasts had gotten their hands on a few copies of wargames like Chainmail and a gaming group developed in the University of Auldhabn on the island. </p>
<p>One of the members, known only by the initials "A.D.", then set their mind towards developing a "man-to-man" i.e. an individual scale game where each player controlled a single unit or a roster of such units, naming it "Sværdtales" (literally, sword-stories, or tales of adventure/war). An avid fan of both fantasy fiction and historical legends, A.D. conscripted his friends to craft an elaborate Nordic-inflected fantasy setting. The result, published in a limited print run in 1976, was a hybrid wargame-roleplaying game that bore traits of both, yet with no overwhelming similarity to Chainmail or any other preceding wargame. Due to its limited print run and small reception outside of the University, Sværdtales (ST) faded into obscurity, and by the time Fafner Spil published an official Havlandic translation of basic D&amp;D materials later in the decade it had almost totally disappeared from circulation.</p>
<p>But this shall not be the fate of ST. We are the original players from the University, and we have come, alongside the friends and descendants of our writer, to recreate the game for the modern world so that all may enjoy this strange yet unique part of Havlandic culture.</p>

<h2 id="game-setup">Game Setup</h2>
<p>There are multiple players at a table, hosted by the Referee. The players and their warbands need not all be allied with each other, but they must be in the same rough geographic region (the Campaign Area) as defined by the referee at the start of the first year. The Referee handles non-player authorities or characters, creates events, and adjudicates combat when it occurs.</p>
<h2 id="player-preparation">Player Preparation</h2>
<p>ST is set in the Eastern Kingdoms (<em>Ostcoronlands</em>), a large, desolate collection of mountains, plains, and moors that borders the vast and unforgiving Eastern Sea. You will each play as a warband (<em>Drott</em>), either in service to a Crown (<em>Corondrott</em>) or as a group of outlaws (<em>Nithdrott</em>).</p>
<h3 id="character-creation">Character Creation</h3>
<p>Each player is in control of a Commander (<em>Drottin</em>). Choose a name and whether you want to begin a servant of a Crown (<em>Coronmann</em>) or an Outlaw (<em>Argarnamde</em>). This is your Alignment. If you begin as an Outlaw, add "Argar" to the front of your name.</p>
<p>All commanders begin at level 1. As they level up, they will gain a new title based on their Alignment and an extra warband, as well as the ability to use money and time to improve their existing warbands. When they reach level 5, they can claim a Crown of their own and establish their own kingdom (<em>Coronland</em>), carving their name on the ancient Crown Monument (<em>Coronstein</em>) at the base of the empty Throne of the High King (<em>Heahkongenstoll</em>).</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>A note on names:</strong> Unlike D&amp;D, one of the most important decisions to be made when creating a ST character is in the name - As the original text writes, "the name can either be as a normal name (Hans, Tom etc.) or Argar- prefixed (Argar-Hans, Argar-Tom), to reflect their societal position." This requires some explanation. "Argar" is a concatenation of the Old Norse word "Argr" repeated twice. The <em>Tandhafnsaga</em>, one of the earliest Havlandic texts, tells of a legendary <em>holmgang</em> (duel to the death) between two sons of the Tandhafn Jarl Erik, Godmund and Sigmund Eriksson, where Godmund confronts Sigmund in the market square with the following challenge: "Argr argr Eriksson!" This line can be roughly translated as "Twice-womanly/twice-unmanly son of Erik", i.e. "Our father's more unmanly son", and <em>argr</em> was a grave insult in Nordic culture at the time. </p>
<p>This phrase ("argr argr") became a ritual challenge in Havland, and over time was shortened into the single word "argar" (thus, the challenge becomes "Argar, Eriksson!"). Later, the word "argar" becomes an adjective connected to the name of the subject, "Argar-Eriksson", denoting one's status as a coward, unmanly, or an outcast. The outcast meaning of the word won out, and by the Kalmar era those who were cast out from Havlandic society would bear the additional title "Argar", and could also be referred to as "argar" (as in "Get out, you <em>argar</em>!"). Some sources also suggest that these "Argarnamde" lost the use of their patronymic, as a punishment for being one of the <em>nithingmann</em> (outcast in Old Havlandic from Old Norse, denoting a status below even that of the "lagrmann" or commoner).</p>

<h3 id="warband-creation">Warband Creation</h3>
<p>Each player is in control of a warband of <strong>1d6+3</strong> soldiers, who move and fight as one. If the commander is Crown-aligned, they are in service to a king, otherwise they are a bandit group. They should be named and a symbol/standard chosen.</p>
<p>Each band has the following scores: Speed (SPD), Armour (AMR), Ranged (RGD), Melee (MEL), and Cold Resistance (CRS), which all start at 0. They are explained below:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Speed (SPD)</strong>: Evasion of ranged attacks. Also adds to movement rate.</li>
<li><strong>Armour (AMR)</strong>: Resistance to melee attacks. Also subtracts from movement rate.</li>
<li><strong>Ranged (RNG)</strong>: Long distance attack capabilities. If 0 or lower, unit cannot attack at range.</li>
<li><strong>Melee (MEL)</strong>: Close range attack capabilities. If 0 or lower, unit cannot attack at melee.</li>
<li><strong>Cold Resistance (CRS)</strong>: Ability to survive in the cold. If 0 or lower, unit perishes if they venture out of a settlement in the winter.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>A note on Dice Notation and Scores:</strong> The original game only used d6s, which we have preserved here. We have also translated all dice formulae to the standard notation to enable an easier play experience. We also use English contractions for scores to prevent confusion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To construct your warband, distribute 10 points amongst the scores. No score can have more than 3 points at the outset of the game.</p>
<h2 id="structure-of-play">Structure of Play</h2>
<p>A year in game has two phases: Summer (<em>Sumor</em>) and Winter (<em>Winter</em>). In the Summer phase you will adventure, war, and make merry. In the Winter phase you will heal, recuperate, and receive the social consequences for your actions (good and bad). The game always begins on the first month of Summer Phase (April).</p>
<h3 id="summer-phase-april-september">Summer Phase (April - September)</h3>
<p>At the beginning of the Summer phase, each player at the table will receive or create a mission with the Referee (Defeat the outlaws in the nearby forest, escort this merchant caravan etc.) of corresponding importance to their title. Thus, a newly-minted Crown Knight might be tasked with hunting a few wild boars, while the Chieftain of a growing outlaw clan may lead a raid on their ancestral enemy kingdom. They may choose to share that information with the other players, or keep it to themselves. The referee will also make public announcements as to any publicly known special occasions (coronstings, festivals, unexplained occurences) that may be to the players' interest.</p>
<p>Either way, play then proceeds in one-month turns. All players write down commands for their respective warbands and hand them to the referee, who adjudicates movement on the Campaign Area map. This can be done via mail (physical or electronic), and players need only be in the same room when conflict erupts or events occur. If the players or referees wish they may engage in record-keeping of supplies, but this is assumed to be handled by their competent warband commanders.</p>
<p>If a player makes a move that will result in some event which requires more than cursory arrangement (i.e. entering a conflict area, the territory of another player or NPC king, or an area with an ongoing event), the Referee will ask the one or more involved players to meet. For rules of battle see the "Combat and Movement" section.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>A Note on Events:</strong> Events were often used in the original ST campaign to spice up the action, and provide some roleplaying opportunities to players, who could meet in peace outside of the field of battle. A <em>Coronsting</em> (Meeting of Crowns) was when several neighbouring Crowns met to discuss trade, mutual defence, or other similar diplomatic matters, and often featured first-blood duels as contests of strength or displays of martial force. Festivals occur during the solstices, to celebrate the first day of the sowing, to celebrate the harvest, and to mark the deaths/births of important noble personnages in the local kingdom.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="winter-phase-october-march">Winter Phase (October - March)</h3>
<p>At the end of the six-month summer phase the sun hangs low and chill creeps into the air. Players should hasten to a friendly settlement to weather the winter. Outlaw warbands must either disguise themselves or secure hospitality (either by threat or by payment), while Crown warbands can stay for free at any settlement allied with their Crown.</p>
<p>If players travel significant distances or fight in the winter each warband must make a Cold Resistance roll: <strong>1d6 + CRS</strong>. On a 4 or lower, they lose 1d6 men. If they march during December, January, or February, they lose 2d6 men on a 6 or lower.</p>
<p>During the winter games are played, stories are told, and consequences are secured. If the players have acted in a manner worthy of levelling up (for example, winning a number of battles equal to their current level or achieving similarly momentous feats), they will recruit a new warband to their side if the settlement is significantly large. Titles are awarded to Crown warbands at a friendly city, usually the one hosting the King (<em>Coron</em>). If, however, they have acted dishonourably or incurred the ire of their men, the Referee may act to take away some of their warbands, or even cast Crown commanders into disgrace as Outlaws (of course, many of their loyal men may follow them nevertheless). Similarly, Outlaws may through their service earn the friendship (or fear) of a local Crown, and therefore be inducted into their hierarchy as a Crown commander of equal level.</p>
<p>Winter is also the time when units that have proven themselves in battle rest, recuerate, and promote. You will receive payment for your services either to your Crown or to the highest bidder in hacksilver. Usually a minor mission will yield 1d6, a moderate mission 2d6, and a major favour 2d6+3. 10 hacksilver can be spent to improve a unit's score in any category by 1 point, or recruit 1 man to a unit. A unit that has been <em>marked for promotion</em> in battle rolls 2d6 and takes the higher when a 1d6 roll is called for from now on, and can never become <em>Weakened</em> again.</p>
<h2 id="combat-and-movement">Combat and Movement</h2>
<h3 id="campaign-movement">Campaign Movement</h3>
<p>Movement in the Campaign Area is over a Hex Grid (or as desired by your Referee) measured in months. A warband has 4 Movement Points (MP) each month, each representing a week's travel. If an event takes up more than half a week, that week's MP is lost. Difficult terrain may take 2 MP to move through, and easy terrain may allow you to move 2 hexes for 1 MP. The size of the hex is determined as the Campaign Area requires (a rough, roadless land of barren crags and mountain fjords will make for much slower travel than green and pleasant plains).</p>
<h3 id="combat-movement">Combat Movement</h3>
<p>Movement in combat is on a per-warband (1 token = 1 warband) scale. Movement is determined by a ruler, and units can move up to 10 + SPD - AMR cm each turn. In the event situations where one side may not be aware of the other's location, the referee may ask for movement orders to be written and handed to them in secret rather than openly moving on the table.</p>
<h3 id="combat-turn">Combat Turn</h3>
<p>A combat turn lasts 6 seconds and is split into phases:</p>
<ol>
<li>Movement phase</li>
<li>Contact phase</li>
<li>Delayed Action phase</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>First</strong>, all units move up to their maximum distance. They may forfeit acting in later phases to move up to twice their distance (charging).</p>
<p><strong>Next</strong>, contact is resolved. Contact is any event where two tokens are in adjacent squares unless both players declare "no contact" and their commanders are in the contacting warbands.</p>
<p>Refer to the statistics of both tokens. If both tokens represent units that:</p>
<ul>
<li>have at least 1 MEL</li>
<li>have not charged, and </li>
<li>are aware of each other (i.e. no surprise or ambush is ruled by the referee)</li>
</ul>
<p>Both sides roll <strong>1d6 + MEL</strong>. The side that rolls higher is the winner, the side that rolls lower the loser. The winner deals the difference in men killed to the loser, minus the loser's AMR score. The loser can always sacrifice a man to force a reroll.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>A note on Heroic Sacrifice:</strong> A heroic sacrifice, or dying well, is a major subject in Germanic cycles or Icelandic sagas. This rule reflects that belief but also injects a gambler's bet into the process. Do you take a confirmed loss for the chance of a greater loss... but also the chance of total victory?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Finally</strong>, resolve delayed actions. These include shooting, fleeing the combat (only possible at the edge of the combat arena), and casting magic if magic is included in this game.</p>
<p>If a ranged attack is called and the opponent is now in range the attacking side rolls <strong>1d6 + RNG - opponent SPD</strong>. The opponent loses that many men. The referee may subtract up to -3 for good cover from casualties, and total cover negates arrow fire entirely.</p>
<h3 id="weakening">Weakening</h3>
<p>When a unit loses half or more of its men it is <em>Weakened</em>. In this state, they roll 2d6 when a 1d6 roll is called for and take the lower roll. If they roll double 1s at any time, they break formation and flee. They are lost forever if you lose the battle, but return to your side if you win. If they roll double 6s at any point, they are <em>marked for promotion</em> if they survive to the next Winter phase.</p>
<h3 id="death">Death</h3>
<p>A unit dies when it has 0 men remaining. The commander is always the last man to die. Even if a unit takes enough damage to be fully wiped out (i.e. 2 men taking 3 damage) the commander will survive. When they are the only man left in a unit the solo combat rules apply.</p>
<h3 id="solo-combat">Solo Combat</h3>
<p>A commander has hits equal to their level. These are ticked off in place of men in a warband when their unit is damaged, and they die when they reach 0 hits. If a commander fights a unit they do not roll 1d6 + MEL. Instead, they treat their MEL or level as the result of the roll, whichever is higher. Similarly if the unit has more than 0 RNG the commander can make ranged attacks, treating their level or RNG as the result of the roll whichever is higher.</p>
<p>If a commander fights another commander (for example, to resolve a <em>holmgang</em>), treat them as a warband with the statistics of their original warband + their level (So they would have a SPD of their original warband's SPD + Level).</p>
<h2 id="magic">Magic</h2>
<p>Magic is used only if the players and the referee agree. To use magic players must hire a Mage (<em>wysard</em>). First, they must demurr the new warband gained by levelling up, or dismiss an existing warband during the Winter phase. Then, they must tavel to a specific location during a specific month to meet the Mage. For example, the Mage of the Woodlands may appear in December at the heart of the woods. Finally, the Commander may ask for the Mage's allegiance, which takes up the resources of one warband. The Mage may then have a quest for the Commander to complete, or if the Commander is sufficiently well-known they will succeed immediately.</p>
<p>Mages have the following statistics: S1 A0 R1 M0 C3. They have 3 hits which are ticked off in place of men in a warband when the unit is damaged, and they die when they reach 0 hits. However, they cannot become Weakened and can also cast powerful Spells, which go off if they haven't been killed before the Delayed Action phase. Each mage has up to 3 spells when they are hired and you can increase that amount by upgrading them during the Winter phase. the spell's effects shall be determined by the Referee but here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Icestorm: Up to 3 enemy warbands the Mage can see in proximity are blinded the next 1d6 turns and must immediately make a Cold Resistance roll as if they were travelling in January.</li>
<li>Charm: Up to 2 enemy warbands the Mage can see in proximity are now under your command their next turn.</li>
<li>Fear: Up to 5 enemy warbands the Mage can see in proximity must spend their next turn charging away.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>A note on magic:</strong> Unlike later RPGs where characters can begin as wizards, a Mage is a momentous figure in ST. There may only be 0-3 Mages in a given Campaign Area, and their arrival is almost always treated as bad news by the local Crowns. Mages stir trouble, spread secret knowledge such as runic or even regular reading and writing, as well as tell stories of strange lands that make peasants... troublesome. It is not uncommon for a Crown to offer a great price for the head of a rumoured Mage, real or not.</p>
