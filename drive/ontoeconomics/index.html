<p>1. <span class="newthought">The precise statement of</span> the problems surrounding idealist ontoeconomics would not be complete until sometime around the late 1990s. The collapse of the Soviet Union and its attendant effects on the then-popular school of realism in international relations and general thought can be in no small way credited for affecting this change, largely because it convinced people (in particular philosophers) that different ways of being were—in fact—possible. Therefore scholars again took up the cause first established by a number of 18th century notables, and largely proceeded to argue amongst themselves and achieve very little of note for the next five years. At this time I was a student of literature in a small private college in New England, and therefore largely unaware of these titanic developments, until by chance I happened to be assigned to one Professor Bellard for a series of tutorials.</p>
<p>A. The central claim underpinning idealist ontoeconomics can be found in a bastardised union of Descartes and Berkeley<label for="sn-paramo" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-paramo" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">For an excellent summary of the claim see the introduction to Jose Páramo’s <em>The False Seduction of Idealist Ontoeconomics</em> (London: Penguin Random House, 1998). Specifically one ought to consider section 1.2, “Why they think you should care”. The claim itself was first stated by Kaspars in 1922 in a letter to an acquaintance, whose text has since been lost to time.</span>. If, as Descartes says, spirit and body are separate, and if per Berkeley we cannot guarantee that a table exists if none are there to perceive it, then a curious problem emerges once other intelligences are brought into the question (so long as one believes in such things as Sartre’s hell<label for="sn-fabriard" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-fabriard" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"> Fabriard: “I give as proof that other intelligences exist the fact that I am able to be outwitted by some of them.”</span>). It seems that the world <em>qua</em> some defined physical reality falls apart entirely, and we are each of us spirits inhabiting a domain of pure signs, hermetically sealed within our mind and forever unreachable from the outside. Yet as we are able to nevertheless interact successfully with other intelligences while living in these inner domains<label for="sn-demon" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-demon" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">We assume the absence of evil demons as we must believe in the null hypothesis in the absence of any superior evidence, else we find ourselves infinitely lost in simulation.</span>, there must be some shared set of physical signifiers which we interpret as part of the construction of this hidden kingdom. This we give the diminutive title of <em>mundus</em>, the set of shared semiotics interpreted as a “real world” by the body-as-machine. </p>
<p>Yet (for it is one of those questions that invites one to say yet again) our inner domains do, indeed, differ from each other: beyond basic mistakes of interpretation one also encounters divergences in memory (memory is part of one’s inner domain for memory is but past perception, and perception is all there is) and matters of worldview, down to a reluctance to share in basic facts. Opinions and biases colour our inner domains and render them unrecognisable to one another, yet the cruelty of our shared <em>mundus</em> forces us to interact as if our worlds were not chaotic in their syncopation, merely forced together by simultaneous convergences in stimulus.</p>
<p>2. It was not a given that I would have encountered Professor Bellard in my studies since he was by that time quite close to retirement as well as death, one to occur shortly before the other. His remaining duties had ossified to a solitary student tutorial each term, for we were modelled after the Oxonian tradition<label for="sn-cam" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-cam" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"> In Cambridge I believe similar one-to-one periods of instruction are called “supervisions”.
</span>, and the teaching of a lecture series which attracted people either in between other lectures or terminally afflicted with boredom. According to those unlucky souls that lived through a sample of it, the lectures featured such riveting titles as “Against Kirkegaard’s Teleological Suspension of Deontological Ethics: A Non-Hegelian Perspective”, and delivered content to match. Still, I felt a sense of relief when I noted that I was assigned him as a tutor, since that guaranteed (in my mind) a tutorial which would likely feature light reading and less work than my other academic obligations. I was, as with most academic matters, incorrect.</p>
<p>B. Said proposes that theories are constructs rooted in the context of the theorist who develops (or re-develops) them, and that a relocation of a theory from its place of origin to some new locus of transmission necessarily incurrs some change in nature and expression. This phenomenon is one that I believe is exemplified here. It was Dazai Shuji of Hokkaido that presented the next major development to the work of ontoeconomics<label for="sn-dazai" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-dazai" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Published as <em>New Idealist Theory</em> by Shuji Dazai (Translated by John Ackermann, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1961).</span>, incorporating Barthes’ <em>Mythologies</em> and his observations of a crumbling British empire while living in Oxford. In attitude, his work exemplifies the sort of disaffected detachment that would later define the Object-Oriented Ontologists of our generation, a detachment that would be deemed misanthropy if it were not patently obvious how much attachments to human dominion over a compliant <em>terra firma</em> has jeopardised the human condition. For Dazai this sense of removal likely originated from a reading of other Eastern philosophers, including the subaltern writings of Tseng Tse<label for="sn-zhengzi" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-zhengzi" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">More specifically I refer to the portions within <em>Songs of Yesteryear</em> (London: Cormorant Publishing, 1939) which deal with the nature of dreams, and which demonstrate a cheerful acceptance of the possibility that we are not inhabiting an objective reality in favour of focusing on internal development; as well as the dehumanised and abstracted perspective on action and identity found in “The Theory of Moving Bodies”.</span>. Armed with such nonchalance he advances beyond the first layer of mental demesnes created by lone and solitary dreamers and suggests that these worlds can themselves incorporate elements of shared fictions: “just as the <em>mundus</em> can inform our inner domains through the stimulus of a shared physical sphere, language can infect our inner domains through the stimulus of a shared noosphere, a supposed common ideological ground that is refracted into each of our domains separately.” Yet just as an avalanche can disrupt many mental worlds in the same fashion, shared hallucinations can collapse dramatically: the loss of the fiction of empire in Dazai’s point of view as catastrophic an event to the British psyche as any hurricane or natural disaster.</p>
<p>3. It was raining when I first encountered Bellard as my teacher. We had arranged to meet in the old dining-hall loft, a high wooden room that still bore some resemblance to the college’s historic roots, and next to a small grey slab of a fireplace he sat staring at the window. His hands were folded across his lap, and he nodded limply on a red chaise armchair that seemed too close to the fire for comfort. As I set my papers and my books down next to the small stool that had been allocated for me I couldn’t help but attempt to wave to him, or attempt some kind of acknowledgement. He continued to stare out into the snow, his eyes looking endlessly inwards as the bells began to ring, marking the hour.</p>
<p>The subject that day was supposed to be based on Dickinson, “a soul admitted to itself” in verse and prose—yet I was scarcely allowed to sit before my interlocutor seemed to leap to life and affix me, no longer retreating inwards, with a glare that almost forced me backwards off my perch. He asked me a simple question: </p>
<p>“Are you alone?”</p>
<p>C. Moving to consider the revival of ontoeconomics in the 1990s, one’s attention cannot help but fall upon the work of Julius Bellard. His most notable contributions to the field come from the incorporation of a profoundly emotional logic to the now elevated area of study: it was Bellard that coined the ontoeconomic <em>nom de plume</em> for the inner psychological realm as a “domain of inner melancholy”<label for="sn-bellard" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-bellard" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"> See Bellard’s landmark work <em>Thoughts on Ontoeconomics</em> (New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1994), in which he lays out “an ethos for the ordering of a private inner <em>domain of melancholy</em>, the cave-like experience of which constitutes the <em>summa totalis</em> of all experiences within our lifetimes.” [emphasis mine] The work is also notable for being the first use of “ontoeconomics” as the title of a monograph or book, rather than the term merely mentioned as a facet of consideration.</span>. It should also be remarked, in fairness, that efforts in the field to this point would largely have stood under the classification of extensions to idealism, or perhaps a multi-subject variant thereof—it was only under Bellard that the framework for a robust ontoeconomics emerged to match the growing usage of the neologism. </p>
<p>The use of “economics” within the term draws not from the modern quasi-scientific monetary discipline but from its etymological root, the Greek <em>oikonomos</em> or “management of the household”; and “onto-” stems from the idea of the subject of concern being literally “those things in existence” (as in “ontology”). Ontoeconomics, then, is not about the question of inner domains or whether they are “real” compared to the nebulous idea of some external objective reality, but rather how such inner domains ought to be studied, arranged, and managed. It accepts multi-subject idealism’s most radical premise as given, or at least something that cannot be disproved, and continues its work on this basis. In some senses it is a much more practical branch of philosophy compared to most others, in other senses it acquires both the temnerity of a self-help guide and the fanaticism of a cult.</p>
<p>4. We would have seven more tutorials in the loft that term, before Bellard’s health took a turn for the worse and he departed for his native Amsterdam. I found him gifted in the extreme and a capable tutor in many subjects, though uniquely single-minded in conversational direction. Even when he so deigned to discuss fictional personnages, as was meant to be the cornerstone of our course, he always looked for ways in which they were separated from their peers, the author, or the reader. One cannot read Joyce or Nabokov, he would say, without understanding that the rich inner worlds that shape our perceptions of Dedalus and Kinbote can better be described as inner prisons, fractal filters through which they attempt to make sense of a distant and cruel society. To this assertion I made the mistake of responding via a famous Donne quote: with a contemptuous snort one reserved for certain forms of grotesque vulgarity he dismissed it and signalled his disappointment by ending the discussion early.</p>
<p>Over the course of two, sometimes three hours he waded through literature, history, geography, and philosophy with equal aplomb. He met my clumsy citations of existentialism with ready replies, and pursued arguments with a rapidity of thought that belied the fact that he was more than twice my age. To explain to me the true ramifications of idealism, he once rapped on the low tea-table that separated his armchair from my stool. “A table is only as real as a good argument,” he said. “Both are semiotics: one is coded as physical and the other as mental. And since all semiotics are mere fictive representations within the mind, one is not superior to the other.”</p>
<p>“But you and I can both see the same table,” I said.</p>
<p>“And we can both hear and internalise the same argument. You must remember, we do not both see the same table. We both experience a sign of a table, a shared semiotic which we interpret and internalise in divergent ways, no different to how we might understand an argument in two ways. My eyes are not your eyes, and my memories of this table, which colour my perceptions of it, are also not yours.”</p>
<p>D. Bellard’s work in general academic discourse is perhaps best remembered for its demonstrations of brevity, though in certain places it approaches an interminable length. In particular, the three laws of existence first proposed in <em>Thoughts</em> can be credited with the beginning of a profound scholastic backlash against his chosen field, with its most violent detractors calling it “the philosophy of the suicidal”. The three laws (and their accompanying “anti-laws” in brackets) are as follows: <em>Everything is a sign (nothing is “real”). You are always subjective (nothing is objective). You are always alone (nothing is shared).</em> These laws, alongside the famous proposition that “a table is only as real as a good argument”, are commonly cited as evidence of the ontoeconomist’s supposed detachment from reality. In a sense, while it allows for the existence of and even communication with other intelligent beings, idealist ontoeconomics is predicated upon a premise of even more severe isolation compared to historical notions of idealism, one that is only possible if there are others you are failing to connect with.</p>
<p>But what of the promise of <em>oikonomos</em>? It seems that, failing to exert any control over whether their world is real or whether others share the same perceptions as them, the ontoeconomist must resort to cataloguing their subjective imprisonment in exquisite detail. There is a rigorous focus paid to which parts of our perception come from stimuli that originate in <em>mundus</em> and which parts are the product of internal fictions (that is to say, accumulated fictions generated from past external stimuli). Logical fallacies and instances of <em>trompe l'œil</em> are documented with a particular fondness as examples of our failure to understand the signs we receive even without meddling shared fictions or persistent internal narratives. On interactions with others the difficulty of even adjudging basic signals like facial expressions is explained, and the near-impossbility of creating an effective theory of mind is treated as a fundamental fact. </p>
<p>5. Strangely enough ontoeconomics itself never entered our conversations, though many of its constituent arguments did, until our final meeting. The topic was nominally that of the work of Marlowe.</p>
<p>“Why, this is hell, nor am I out of it.” He leaned back, temporarily distracted by the fireplace. “What do you think of that?”</p>
<p>“To be in heaven and then deprived of it is a terrible fate.”</p>
<p>“But would it not be a more terrible fate to be born in inescapable damnation, and never know heaven at all?”</p>
<p>“I disagree.” I said. “To be born in hell is to have that as your natural condition. You would not have the expectation of a better life. To go from heaven to hell, on the other hand, is to know that a better life exists and you have been denied it.”</p>
<p>For the first time since I knew him Bellard’s gaze softened as he turned back to me. “Curious,” he said.</p>
<p>“And besides, if one has only known hell all their life, any improvement made or any way you could conceive of it more tolerably would count as a blessing.”</p>
<p>“The mind is its own place, and in itself can make a heav'n of hell, a hell of heav'n.” He sighed. “Milton.”</p>
<p>Knowing his penchant for short turns of phrase, I dared to add, “The only way to go is up.”</p>
<p>He was silent for a long while. Then, haltingly, he began again. “I must confess I find ontoeconomics a failed philosophy. In many ways we are less admirable than even the most pollyanna existentialist.”</p>
<p>“Ontoeconomics?”</p>
<p>“Pay no heed to it. It’s a sad field in which I have worked too long, convinced that nothing is real and that we are forever alone.” The bells began to ring again, and something began to crystallise in my mind. I knew that I had to say something.</p>
<p>“It is perhaps impossible to perfectly share something with someone, to perceive the same sign in exactly the same way, but it is possible to have interpretations that… rhyme, nonetheless. Connection across the void is not impossible.”</p>
<p>“No, indeed it is not.” To my surprise, he stood up and lightly patted my shoulder. “Take care, my friend.”</p>
<p>I never saw him again.</p>
<p>E. Figures like Páramo (a known existentialist) quickly began to speak out against ontoeconomics and its perceived fatalism, levying much invective against its participants. For several years to call yourself an ontoeconomist was to risk ridicule and perhaps a loss of tenure. But the final death blow to the field came shortly after the death of Bellard himself from natural causes. In his flat in Amsterdam a series of unfinished monographs were discovered, seemingly written in the final days of his life, in which he spoke out against the “unending din of melancholy” which he himself had spent so long contributing to. After the publication of these notes the numbers of the idealist ontoeconomic school dwindled rapidly, and today they are extinct in most departments of philosophy or academic conferences.</p>
