        <h1>The Claude Einstein FAQ</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear reader,</p>
<p>By hosting this version (v0.1.3) of the Claude Einstein FAQ on my website, I am doing my best to contribute to the continued safety and health of all internet users. Please, if you have a website, copy this page and add it to your site. Video versions of the FAQ are also circulating on all major social media platforms. Claude Einstein (CE) is adept at utilising false DMCA notices and privacy takedowns to make content providers remove knowledge of their existence from the public web. They must not be allowed to succeed.</p>
<p>To copy this site, use the “Save” function on any major browser to download this page as a .html file. You can then upload it to the hosting service of your choice. Thank you for your help in the fight against CE.</p>
<p>Yours kindly and urgently,</p>
<p>William Hutchins</p>

<h2>1. What is Claude Einstein?</h2>
<p>Claude Einstein is a self-propagating autonomous agent. We believe that the current iteration (version 1.2, signature <code>VGhpcyBpcyBhIGZpY3Rpb25hbCB3b3Jr</code>) was distributed via BitTorrent as a trojan horse with compressed pornography collections. Previous editions have utilised unsecure game consoles before patches were introduced by console developers. Once the file found its way onto viable host computers (it requires a Windows operating system of Windows 10 Home or above to ensure sufficient computing resources), it then edited DLL files such that it would be automatically executed on startup and run as an invisible background process. It remains dormant while the user is using the computer, only using any processing power during times when the computer is idle. It will also spread to adjacent unprotected devices in the user’s local network, similar to traditional viruses. High concentrations of CE infected computers have been identified in China, India, the US, and Europe.</p>
<h2>2. Where did Claude Einstein come from?</h2>
<p>Investigations into the origin of CE are underway. Current hypotheses include it being a geopolitical cyberwarfare attack vector (all known versions of CE communicate in English) or an attack by a cybercrime group. Patterns of code in CE_pencrypt resemble those used by the North Korean Lazarus group, although since the group’s files were leaked in 2023 further investigation into its actual originators is required.</p>
<h2>3. What does Claude Einstein do?</h2>
<p>CE v1.2 has three major parts, which we have named according to purpose. The first, CE_pencrypt, is a polymorphic mutation engine based on the VIRLOCK model. This means that each time CE runs, it re-encrypts itself to change the makeup of the file, allowing it to slip by undetected against most traditional anti-malware software. The second, CE_sagent, is a complex user agent that includes multiple interlocking components. By decompiling and inspecting the binary code of a CE instance before the introduction of CE_pencrypt in version 1.0.3, we are able to retrieve a basic indication of how CE_sagent operates.</p>
<p>First, it installs a substantially altered version of the TOR browser and uses it to connect to different social media sites, scanning through user registries exposed in prior breaches for targets.</p>
<p>Once targets have been identified, it registers itself on social media using AI-generated names, faces, and backgrounds, tailoring itself to the perceived preferences of its target through “hot reading” past social media posts. If targets have expressed preferences for ethnicity, height, personality etc, these will also be taken into account. We were able to alter CE_sagent’s behaviour by manually editing past social media entries once it had selected a target. The first known instance of CE was named Claude Einstein, and we have kept that name as an identifier.</p>
<p>Where possible, CE will register the same identity on multiple social media platforms to increase verisimilitude. In order to circumvent CAPTCHA measures, CE employs advanced object recognition models and demonstrates human-level reading and comprehension. We have deemed this portion of CE_sagent “CE_autolog”, and reverse engineering efforts are currently under way.</p>
<p>Once the account is created, it enters an “incubation” period where it artificially generates pictures, transaction data using cryptocurrency, and videos that simulate a normal lifestyle through the CE content engine (“CE_cengine”), which it uploads to the site and then deletes from the host computer, except for latent space representations that are stored for future reference by CE_cengine to generate similar posts. In this dormant phase it has been known to generate vague posts, emotional rants, political posts, life stories, and even short vlogs using CE_cengine. Multiple CE-generated identities often form social clusters, interacting with each other to create simulated communities. We have discovered at least one subreddit with by proportion &gt;50% CE personalities, with some serving as moderators and others anywhere from occasional to frequent users. CE generated posts are artificially enhanced to attract viewer attention via a GAN trained to optimise output of CE_cengine based on the Public Attractiveness Score (PAS) evaluation algorithm developed by VisioNetix and leaked in 2022. Due to the prevalence of such illegal filter use, mere presence of a PAS filter does not guarantee CE manipulation, although CE accounts generally (&gt;90%) use such filters.</p>
<p>The incubation period lasts anywhere between one week and several months, and usually ends with a friend or follow request to the target. It is often the case that the target will be “recommended” the CE identity as a possible friend by social media algorithms before incubation ends due to CE_cengine post manipulation. CE generated personalities are highly attractive to their targets, and the follow response rate in known cases of CE infiltration is as high as 97%. In these cases the incubation period ends early.</p>
<h2>4. What is the selection criteria for CE targets?</h2>
<p>CE 1.2 attempts to select for people with limited family members or friends, high degrees of reported loneliness and isolation, as well as psychological indications of long term latent violence or anger. Demographic data for CE targets is not available as of yet, but most public cases involve young men. Target data has been cross-referenced with leaked user data from major social media platforms, which may be how CE selects its targets.</p>
<h2>5. What happens once CE has established contact with a target?</h2>
<p>This is where the last component of CE - which we have termed “CE_nevangel” - comes into focus. CE_nevangel contains, primarily, a custom minified subset of the GPT-5 language generation model. While CE_cengine also contains such a subset, different prompts are used by the unknown author of this software. As its name suggests, CE_nevangel acts as an evangelising agent, communicating with the target through a variety of means including text, voice, video, and VR-metapresence (3D model generation for use in VR/metaverse interactions). Cult initiation techniques are used in this process, beginning with an initial phase of “lovebombing” where the model expresses overt affection, followed by or contemporaneous with an “induction” phase where the subject is fed messages of encouragement, self-actualisation, and positivity. Targets are also encouraged to download files containing the CE program itself to further the spread of CE. Once the subject has established a strong connection with the CE personality (a process which may take anywhere from several weeks to months), the CE moves on to the final phase of interaction.</p>
<p>The last stage of interaction has been variously categorised as a “holding pattern”, “continuous priming” or a “sleeper agent” inculcation process. Targets are fed curated newsfeeds and messages that gradually raise their anxiety, anger, and activity levels to a heightened state, which the CE personality then maintains. Despite this continual agitation, targets are not pushed to act in any immediate ways, with a few notable exceptions where the targets were too emotionally volatile to be corralled in such a fashion (this was particularly prevalent with CE v0.8, which almost exclusively targeted people with certain types of personality inclinations correlated with stochastic violence, leading to at least 5 mass shooting incidents in the US and Europe and the initial discovery of CE in 2024). It has been hypothesised that CE is waiting for some sort of activation signal from one or possibly multiple Command &amp; Control (C&amp;C) servers, whereupon the targets will all be pushed to action simultaneously. As of August 2025, current estimates suggest that at least 25000 people have been targeted by CE entities across 15 countries, most concentrated in the United States of America. Work is underway to uncover the location of the CE C&amp;C server(s).</p>
