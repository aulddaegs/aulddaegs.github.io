            <h1>What is Alpha Capital Management...</h1>
<p><em>...And why is it about to crash the American economy?</em></p>
<p>By <strong>TanquanExUngueLeonem</strong></p>
<h2>The Beginning</h2>
<p>So, you've heard of Alpha Capital Management (ACM). Maybe you've heard of their high-but-not-ludicrous APY. Maybe you saw the usual suspects on twitter singing its disruptive praises. Maybe you're a little doubtful. Well, friend, you're in the right place. But to begin, we first need to go back...</p>
<h2>Back to the Future of the Past</h2>
<p>In the early 2020s crypto shit was all the rage. It seems ridiculous now, but for a while otherwise quite serious video essayists seriously suggested that it might crowbar its way into all of our lives, and thereby make itself too big to fail. A lot of Silicon Valley techbros bet their fortunes on crypto "going macro", and go macro it did. If by macro you mean wiping out a sum total of almost 20 billion dollars of American wealth over five years, that is. After that people stopped laughing at the funny monkey jpegs and started saying words like "wire fraud" instead.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the collapse of crypto's banking access also meant no more fun speculative money ~~laundering~~ games, so all of our newly minted international diplomats and expatriates in non-extradition countries needed new things to bet on. I promise, somewhere down the line I'll actually introduce Alpha Capital Management, but for now we need to talk about the Fixed Value Tradeable Contract (FVTC). If ACM is a nuclear bomb nested in the heart of our financial system, the FVTC is the uranium.</p>
<h2>What is an FVTC?</h2>
<p>Bear with me while I run through the boring shit. An FVTC, to borrow a famous dead guy, is neither fixed value, nor tradeable, nor a contract. It's a bit of writing that represents some kind of future obligation, which can then be traded or bet upon like another financial instrument. For example, I promise you 20 barrels of oil two weeks down the line. You promise to pay me whatever 2000 USD is worth in GBP for those 20 barrels of oil. We might even agree that if I can't give you the oil I owe you some kind of penalty. Once we both sign an FVTC, for example with the JP Morgan SmartMarket contract programme, that is then lodged as an "outstanding obligation" with both of our banks (which can be three thousand miles away so long as their country is part of the Lausanne Compact which established these damn things) until the FVTC "comes due" in two weeks. JP Morgan is the issuing bank for this FVTC, and both of our banks are executor banks.</p>
<p>When an FVTC comes due, the issuing bank checks that the obligation has been fulfilled (a process called "ceritification"), and executes the contract automatically. If, during that week, the relative price of USD soars compared to GBP, then you get a heck of a lot more GBP. This is to hedge against inflation and other market crashes, ensuring that the value of the FVTC remains constant no matter what happens (hence, "fixed value"). This does not mean, however, that the FVTC is always worth as much as it was when we signed the deal. If a microwar breaks out in the middle east and sends oil prices skyrocketing, the "fixed value" part of the contract might mean that you're getting a sweet deal for these oil barrels. If on the other hand oil prices crash, then you might really not want to pay for those oil barrels. This is where "tradeable" part comes in.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some might even call these "souped up futures", but who am I to say that?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once an FVTC is signed, it is also "released" by the issuing bank onto an open marketplace where people can bet on its value and, more importantly, so can we. If the receiving party think that oil prices are going to soar, they can sell part of the oil they are due on the market. If, on the other hand, we think we're really getting a shit deal, we can look for someone who wants to sell oil more (for example, if they have a surplus or supply chain glut), and then transfer our obligation to them. Of course, this is depending on the current other party agreeing that this transfer makes sense. Changes to FVTCs before they mature are called "migrations": Migrations that affect "material change" on the conditions of the FVTC (e.g. changing the delivery location or payout currency of the oil) are called "mutual agreement" migrations, meaning all involved parties need to agree; and migrations that don't (e.g. promising to sell on a fraction of your oil once you get it) are called "single-side" migrations, meaning they can be done by any party acting on their own. Usually these are decided before the FVTC is signed, to prevent costly lawsuits happening while the FVTC is "live". Either way, at the end of the day 20 barrels of oil change hands for the equivalent of 2000 USD. </p>
<p>The public nature of these FVTCs also allows for bets to be made on the stocks of companies signing them. If Saudi Aramco has agreed to deliver oil, failing to deliver that oil might lead to a drop in its stock price based on the size of the obligation, and if I think they're going to fail that obligation I might take note of the size of the FVTC and shortsell Saudi Aramco accordingly. There are even outlandish tactics available like arranging to buy out the supply side of the FVTC without touching any mutual-agreement conditions, and then intentionally failing to fulfill the contract to starve a competitor of materials or products. Those were largely during the early days of FVTCs, when people hadn't quite ironed out all of the loopholes, and the US government ran a very effective trade war against Chinese electronics manufacturers by strategically sinking electronics FVTCs in the European and Asian open markets. Anyways, you get the point: Multiple levels of speculation wrapped up in a single instrument.</p>
<h2>But why is an FVTC?</h2>
<p>At this point, you might be wondering why anyone would use an FVTC instead of a traditional contract. The answer is simple: volatility. In a world where an earthquake can pop up out of nowhere and a cyberattack render a production plant helpless for weeks on end with no warning, it just doesn't make sense to use traditional supply and demand contracts in a deeply interconnected economic system filled with long multistage international supply chains. You <em>need</em> to be able to switch suppliers at the drop of a hat, and the market needs to be able to guarantee on some level that large, systemic load-bearing institutions and corporations get what they ask for. Sometimes you need oil so bad that you're willing to pay a premium to get some other company's oil shipment when the associated FVTC matures. This is Dave Harvey's idea of "short-range capital turnover" and hedging against volatility, applied to the logic of supply and demand itself.</p>
<p>But, of course, none of this actually solves the problems that cause volatility. Climate change is still wrecking the economy, causing trillions of dollars of damage. Just in time supply chains are still a terrible idea. You can't rebuild fast enough. All this is doing is stacking risk on risk, hoping that one of your twenty bets pays off before the bill comes due. And here is where Alpha Capital Management comes in.</p>
<h2>Give me an FVTC for my FVTC</h2>
<p>One of the things you need for an FVTC to make sense is some kind of collateral. This can be a promise to pay out money in case of a failure on the supply or demand side, or some kind of insurance that guarantees compensation in the event that the FVTC falls through and no-one is willing to buy out the failing side's obligation. Either way, collateral needs to be pledged - i.e., locked up - for most FVTCs before the contract starts, and if a different party steps in they need to provide similar or equivalent collateral before they can take on the obligation to fulfill part of the FVTC. Swapping collateral sources is almost always a mutual-agreement migration, and most FVTCs have "margin call" clauses in the event that pledged collateral starts to lose its value. This can mean liquidating stock or shares, if the collateral is a security, or selling off pledged assets if they are physical assets. <strong><em>This will be important later.</em></strong></p>
<p>Alpha Capital Management is an FVTC collateral provider. For a fee, they will pledge some part of their assets as collateral for an FVTC, in a manner like underwriting a mortgage. If it goes well, the FVTC matures, the obligation is fulfilled, and ACM gets their assets back with a healthy fee profit. If it doesn't, ACM loses the assets. They're essentially placing bets on FVTCs succeeding, and they've grown to have a market cap of some 30 billion USD as of last week, on the hook for supplying FVTC collateral of up to 10 billion dollars at any moment. Unfortunately, the way they've pulled this off is... unorthodox, to say the least.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In my line of business we call this "sus as shit". </p>
</blockquote>
<p>You see, ACM doesn't offer their assets. They offer an FVTC promising to supply the assets in the event of a default. This <em>sounds</em> like it's functionally equivalent, but it isn't. The contract here is an FVTC between the issuing bank of the first FVTC and ACM, where the issuing bank receives an option to liquidate some amount of ACM's Capital Funds (a combination of liquid currency, government bonds, and stocks) in the event of a default. The fund comes from people who have paid into ACM for a share of the profits, and because of the "fixed value" of the contract the precise nature of the funds is not locked down. Instead, ACM promises to always have enough assets in its Capital Fund to cover the simultaneous loss of every FVTC it provides collateral for. Furthermore, because the collateral is itself an FVTC, ACM can sell or sublet its obligations to other parties provided that it always carries final responsibility for coughing up collateral, and doesn't trip the threshold for a mutual-agreement migration. This, as you can expect, is where the fuckery begins, with a little company called Tetragrammaton Investments.</p>
<h2>WTF is Tetragrammaton Investments??</h2>
<p>Tetragrammaton Investments has a website that describes it as a "private financial opportunity innovator" and an email address that bounces. Besides that, it has no other means of contact, and its address is a rent-an-office somewhere in Silicon Valley. Its website shows no employees, and its corporate filings list a single person who acts as its CEO... and nobody else. Unfortunately, this private hedge fund? investor fund? money laundering scheme??? is also responsible for about 10% of the total collateral pledged by ACM.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Again, "sus as shit".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why would anyone buy the obligation to supplying collateral? Well, ACM promises to pay Tetragrammaton a small fee for taking on 9.8% of the collateral risk - basically the same deal ACM takes, except one layer down. 10%, incidentally, is also the threshold for reporting this kind of debt obligation according to the Californian Department of Financial Protection and Innovation. Tetragrammaton has taken this deal for just about every FVTC that ACM insures, meaning that it has outstanding liabilities of up to 1 billion dollars at any time. And what assets does it use to insure that it can pay up?</p>
<p>ACM shares. It's fucking ACM shares. Well, technically it's the assets in Tetragrammaton's own Innovation Capital Fund, but those assets come from three offshore investor funds based in Malta (that bastion of financial responsibility) that own pretty much nothing except shares in ACM. The sole employee of Tetragrammaton, Samuel Barley, was one of the founders of ACM (though he has since left the company), and ACM has not done any kind of offloading except to Tetragrammaton. For ACM, though, this is great: it can basically now spread its assets amongst many more FVTCs, since not every FVTC will be of the same size, netting more of those sweet sweet collateral fees. And so long as ACM keeps growing and therefore its stock price keeps rising, it can always say that it's done its due diligence and determined that Tetragrammaton can undertake this risk. They've essentially added their own equity to their Capital Fund pool. And before you say "that sounds like a smart idea", let me stop you right there.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You might instead try "this sounds like FTX", which has the benefit of actually being true.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Is this a dumb idea then?</h2>
<p>Yes. This is a dumb idea. This is a horrifically risky idea that only works when ACM's stock price keeps going up. This is an idea that will blow up the whole house of cards, because ACM underwrites a whole lot of FVTCs. This means that, statistically speaking, if there's any sign of a recession and more than a few of these FVTCs go bust, a solid chunk of ACM stock will be liquidated to pay out the collateral. This will drive down ACM's stock price, meaning that ACM is now underwriting more FVTCs than they have money to pay out (this is because 10% of all of their FVTC collateral is being backed by Tetragrammaton assets, which are ACM shares, which are now worth less than they used to, and they don't have the capital to make up the difference). And if people notice, they'll start trying to margin call the collateral to make sure that their FVTC remains collateralised. Remember those margin call clauses? Yeah, here's where they come in. All of a sudden all those stocks, shares, and bonds get liquidated by ACM to fulfill their obligations, creating financial contagion that ripples out across the markets. ACM is a dead man walking, and a lot of people are going down with it when it finally croaks.</p>
<p>But that's not all. ACM is one of the top underwriters of the FVTC game. They're listed as the preferred collateral provider of this dickery by JP Morgan and HSBC and the Neom Global Investment Bank. Once ACM goes down, there's no longer anyone to collateralise these FVTCs. FVTCs that power global supply chains. Without underwriters shipping and logistics become infinitely more risky, the same risks FVTCs were created to avoid, and it no longer makes financial sense to continue operating in this incredibly volatile environment. At that point we're looking at serious systemic risk.</p>
<h2>So what happens now?</h2>
<p>I don't know. CNBC loves ACM, and so does Jim Cramer. A whole bunch of douchebag techbros have lined up behind FVTCs as another piece of "fintech disruption", urging its immediate adoption far and wide. Maybe the government will have to bail ACM out. What I do know is that a lot of good, honest people and organisations have paid into ACM for the rates it offers. Its collapse will affect pension funds, retirement funds, and savings; not to mention the jobs that will be cut as companies desperately try to act "efficient" to regain investor trust and those sweet sweet stock price valuations. Like crypto, the worst off will be the worst affected by the crisis: If ACM goes down, it won't be pretty, and the people who lose out won't be the millionaires. </p>
<p>If only we could stop making the same mistake over and over again.</p>
