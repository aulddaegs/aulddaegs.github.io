<p><em>To elect the president of the United States</em></p>
<p><em>The weather is perfect in New York City</em></p>
<p><em>Be prepared to be seen on camera…</em></p>
<p>And if they fucking steal the election again we show them how its done and blow their brains out</p>
<p>If you see illegals voting in your area, tell any police officer and they’ll take care of it</p>
<p>Rapists and criminals in prisons are fed with public money and pollute freely without contributing to society. IT’S NOT TOO LATE—Vote for a candidate who supports expanding the death penalty. Help save the next generation and the planet</p>
