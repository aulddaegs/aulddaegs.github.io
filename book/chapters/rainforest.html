    <h1>RAINFOREST (Man)
</h1>
    <div class="book-content">
        <p>When they discover me, they call me Rainforest Man because they can't pronounce my name.</p>
<p>On day one the internet laughed from my phone, from my friend's phones.</p>
<p>On day two my countrymen threaten me for destroying the economy.</p>
<p>On day three an intellectual sends me an exact breakdown of the carbon footprint of my tent suspended in the trees, down to the disposable water bottle I am seen drinking out of in my daily vlogs.</p>
<p>On day four they drop the subtlety and shout with a megaphone about criminal charges. They leave by midnight, but come back at four in the morning.</p>
<p>On day five I fall asleep. I forget to vlog and the internet says I've given up, gone home. The stay-at-home environmentalists call me phoney.</p>
<p>On day six they abuse me for the colour of my skin.</p>
<p>On day seven there is smoke. Before nightfall the fire does the company's work for them. My tent is caught in the fire, but I survive.</p>
<p>On day eight there is no more rainforest sector 49.</p>
<p>I start walking.</p>
