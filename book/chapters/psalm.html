    <h1>A Psalm for the Dying
</h1>
    <div class="book-content">
        <p><em>A poem by the anonymous writer “P. K. W”, published as a video set to footage of various natural disasters and civil wars.</em></p>
<p><strong>Voice 1:</strong></p>
<p>Time</p>
<p>Call time somewhere else</p>
<p>Call time in the forests, in the seas, in the beaten desert streets</p>
<p>Call time beneath the melting houses, melting people, melting squalid worthless skulls</p>
<p>victims of wars in other places</p>
<p>We will not weep if we avoid their faces</p>
<p>Do not call time at home</p>
<p>Home, that formless sacred place</p>
<p>Home, which is muchplentymanyhappysafe</p>
<p>Keep sacred home away from the wave</p>
<p>That comes crashing down in the kind of disgust they call repentance</p>
<p>We’ll live cheap and free until the day</p>
<p><em>On Kai Me On</em> goes the other way</p>
<p><strong>Voice 2:</strong></p>
<p>What’s that mean?</p>
<p><strong>Voice 1:</strong></p>
<p><em>On Kai Me On</em>, to be and not to be</p>
<p>Delicious Ruthless Gentle Question—ha!</p>
<p>Remember that it’s our right to choose</p>
<p>The way the world ends</p>
<p>And if it just so happens that we want to have a little fun</p>
<p>Before its all quite said and done</p>
<p>Then that’s our god-given right as well</p>
<p><strong>Voice 2:</strong></p>
<p>Everyone deserves a good life, don’t they?</p>
<p><strong>Voice 3:</strong></p>
<p>The voice from the newspaper calls delay</p>
<p>The voice from the television concurs</p>
<p>The voice on youtube says, go backwards</p>
<p>It is always the conquerors that reserve the right to choose </p>
<p>how we move on from their ruins.</p>
