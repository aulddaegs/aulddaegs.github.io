        <p><em>From the journal of the anonymous writer “P. K. W.”, published by his family after his suicide. Included with his original notes.</em></p>

<p><strong>BRAINFIRE.</strong></p>
<p>Sharp illuminous pain of dawn of ice of easter-coming fire!</p>
<p>You come and dance and make merry the loss of true fathom’d desire!</p>
<p>Make of the world a vast and airy plain, and remain</p>
<p>Unable to find one to point you the way</p>
<p>No, my feet are better as roots, good sir</p>
<p>And my head’s better on a pike.</p>
<p>MIDNIGHT IN THE CITY.</p>
<p>Midnight comes to the roofs</p>
<p>To the ruined palace, to the drunks and to the serpentine streets</p>
<p>Midnight comes to the sleeping, to the drowned, to the dancers loud and gay</p>
<p>Midnight does not come to me</p>
<p>To be in the city is to face the locked door, the closed alley</p>
<p>The unwelcome face, the shuttered house</p>
<p>To be in the city is to wander alone</p>
<p>There is no home within the city</p>
<p>There is no home in earth and ash and bone</p>
<p>City takes up living dying breathing crying</p>
<p>Wraps it up in light, light to ward against the dark</p>
<p>Light, tis how you know the night has come</p>
<p>But that light is not for me</p>
<p>My eyes are hungry as I wander these streets</p>
<p>Looking for a sliver of friend or foe</p>
<p>But the lights show me nobody</p>
<p>Give me dark instead, for in the dark</p>
<p>I might run up against an old acquaintance, and pass unknowing</p>
<p>Rather than risk the unturned face</p>
<p>The unanswered word</p>
<p>The unnatural fact that I am singular, indivisible, discrete</p>
<p>Alone</p>
<p>THE SCHOOL LUNCH-TABLE.</p>
<p>Survey the scene, a thousand sets of eyes.</p>
<p>But nine-hundred ninety-nine are not for you!</p>
<p>The groups have collated, singular, indivisible, discrete</p>
<p>There is not slit, no sliver, no path in</p>
<p>Tis the pains and tribulations of childhood</p>
<p>Now take that moment and form a life.</p>
<p>TIME.</p>
<p>The sweeping hand of time descends, and wipes the moments from the trends</p>
<p>From three shots it makes a Kuleshov purgatory.</p>
<p>What then? What then?</p>
<p>Do you chance disaster again?</p>
<p>Or stand athwart the empty waste and demand a moment of precious light?</p>
<p>Light’s for others don’t you forget.</p>
<p>It’s easier to write with misery and regret.</p>
<p>DIVISION.</p>
<p>A man is in a thousand synocapted parts divided.</p>
<p>A voice a trend a hand an eye a wink the parts they do descend</p>
<p>Quoth Althusser thus do manners and motives maketh man</p>
<p>I write best in misery and regret</p>
<p>That human part, drop it and then ascend</p>
<p>To realms purer than that, and solve the problems that Man desires</p>
<p>Make yourself a god, a god’s worth an infinity of pain, no?</p>
<p>A god’s capacity for pain is infinite</p>
<p>UNITY.</p>
<p>Eudaimonia. Curse it! Worse it!</p>
<p>Can’t even eat, what’s the point of it!</p>
<p>It stays the wandering hand, that begs the knife</p>
<p>To end misery and regret</p>
<p>No, you have work to do, you’re not done just yet.</p>
<p>So take the parts and weave ‘em</p>
<p>Till you’re done and do deceive ‘em</p>
<p>Make a man from the ashes, and drive</p>
<p>The rest from your idle head.</p>
<p>ENVOI.</p>
<p>Sharp illuminous pain of dawn of ice of easter-coming fire!</p>
<p>You come and dance and make merry the loss of true fathom’d desire!</p>
<p>You are welcome here.</p>
