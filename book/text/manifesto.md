The Passivist Manifesto
*Excerpt from a twitter thread by Aristotle Longman on the 28th of March, 2020.*

1. There is no teleology, there is no destiny, there is no promised land.
2. Knowing is not understanding. Understanding is not controlling. You are not in control.
3. Material interests will be protected with material disparitiesâ€”Change happens only when they relent or make a mistake.
4. Stubborness is death. Adaptation is survival. Lie down rather than struggle against the tide.
