A Psalm for the Dying
*A poem by the anonymous writer “P. K. W”, published as a video set to footage of various natural disasters and civil wars.*

**Voice 1:**
Time
Call time somewhere else
Call time in the forests, in the seas, in the beaten desert streets
Call time beneath the melting houses, melting people, melting squalid worthless skulls
victims of wars in other places
We will not weep if we avoid their faces

Do not call time at home
Home, that formless sacred place
Home, which is muchplentymanyhappysafe
Keep sacred home away from the wave
That comes crashing down in the kind of disgust they call repentance
We’ll live cheap and free until the day
*On Kai Me On* goes the other way

**Voice 2:**
What’s that mean?

**Voice 1:**
*On Kai Me On*, to be and not to be
Delicious Ruthless Gentle Question—ha!
Remember that it’s our right to choose
The way the world ends
And if it just so happens that we want to have a little fun
Before its all quite said and done
Then that’s our god-given right as well

**Voice 2:**
Everyone deserves a good life, don’t they?

**Voice 3:**
The voice from the newspaper calls delay
The voice from the television concurs
The voice on youtube says, go backwards

It is always the conquerors that reserve the right to choose 
how we move on from their ruins.
