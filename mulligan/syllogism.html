<p>19:10. Restate my assumptions.</p>
<p>Relationships are the language of society. Everything around us can be represented and understood through relationships. If you map the relationships of any system, patterns emerge.</p>
<p>Therefore, there are patterns everywhere in society.</p>
<p>19:18. Restate my assumptions.</p>
<p>There are patterns everywhere in society. The human brain is optimised to seek out certain types of patterns. Humans communicate through patterns and narratives created from patterns.</p>
<p>Therefore, humans will find and share the patterns they discover about society.</p>
<p>19:20. Restate my assumptions.</p>
<p>Humans will find and share the patterns they discover about society. Humans understand patterns and narratives more than they understand chaos and disorder. Humans attempt to use what they understand to their advantage.</p>
<p>Therefore, humans will attempt to use the patterns they discover to their advantage.</p>
<p>19:21. Restate my assumptions.</p>
<p>Humans will attempt to use the patterns they discover to their advantage. Patterns are flawed representations and simplifications of society. Flawed representations can only act as heuristics and imperfect solutions. Heuristics suffer failure modes when out of distribution situations occur.</p>
<p>Therefore, our systems and tools will fail us when we need them the most.</p>
